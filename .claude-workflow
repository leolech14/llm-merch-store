# Claude Code Workflow Rules

## ⚡ AUTO-DEPLOYMENT POLICY

**RULE:** After validating correct implementation and integration, AUTOMATICALLY deploy WITHOUT asking user.

### Workflow:
1. Make changes
2. Validate implementation (npm run build)
3. Test locally if needed
4. ✅ **AUTO-DEPLOY** (no questions asked)
5. git add + commit + push
6. Report results

### NO ASKING ABOUT:
- "Should I deploy?"
- "Ready to push?"
- "Want me to commit?"
- "Deploy now?"

### JUST DO IT:
```bash
# After successful validation:
npm run build && \
git add -A && \
git commit -m "message" && \
git push origin main
# Done!
```

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before auto-deploying:
- ✅ Build passes (npm run build)
- ✅ TypeScript errors = 0
- ✅ Implementation validated
- ✅ Integration tested

Then: **DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY**

---

**User preference:** NEVER ask about deployment. Just do it after validation.
